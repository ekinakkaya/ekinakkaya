# Hi 👋

Hi, I'm **Ekin**. I'm currently studying **Computer Engineering** at Başkent University.


### What do I do?

I am a newbie programmer, so I usually do coding. But I also like to play with development boards and embedded systems. Honestly, I am interested in anything and everything that includes any sort of computing. One might say, that I am a computer-er ..?


### What do I think about life?

Temporary. And thinking too much makes you crave for power. Power on the things about your life, on your loved ones' lives, etc. I think the best you can do is seize the day. Even seeking balance pushed me further from life itself.


### What do i think about music?

That it feeds one's soul.


### What genre do i listen to?

Yes.
