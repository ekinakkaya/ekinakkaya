## Hi 👋

Hi, I'm **Ekin**. I'm currently studying **Computer Engineering** at Başkent University.
I love developing and desining projects. I especially love the grey space between two, where *creativity* and *tranquility* merges.

I’m currently learning **web development** to be able to create the projects that I want to create.
